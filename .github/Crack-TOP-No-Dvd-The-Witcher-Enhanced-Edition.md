If you want to use Sourcetree 3.x with gitLab, you can follow these steps. First, you need to enable the option to accept gitLab in Sourcetree. You can find this option in the Tools menu, under Options->Authentication. Click on Add and select gitLab from the drop-down list.

Next, you need to configure your remote gitLab repository in Sourcetree. Go to Settings and click on Add. Enter the name, host and URL of your gitLab repository. You can also choose the protocol (HTTPS or SSH) and the default branch. Click on OK to save the settings.
  
Finally, you need to make sure that your git client version is compatible with gitLab. If you are using an older version of git that is no longer supported by gitLab, you may encounter errors when pushing or pulling changes. To avoid this, you can switch to the embedded Git that comes with Sourcetree. This will ensure that you have the latest version of git that works with gitLab. To do this, go to Tools->Options->Git and select Embedded from the Git Version section at the bottom. Sourcetree may download the embedded Git if it is not already installed.
